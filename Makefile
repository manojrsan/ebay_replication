# Reflection:
# The Makefile makes explicit the dependency relationships between raw data, code,
# generated outputs, and the final paper. Unlike run_all.sh, which simply lists
# commands to execute in order, the Makefile declares which files depend on which
# inputs This allows Make to rebuild only the components that changed, improving
# efficiency and reproducibility. The dependency graph is now visible to collaborators,
# making the project structure transparent. In contrast, run_all.sh left these
# relationships implicit and required reverse-engineering to understand the workflow.
